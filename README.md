[Vixx Store](https://vixxstore.netlify.app/) is a E-commerce Website Project simulating a Clothes Brand Store. In this early version, there are some functions not working yet.

There is no login support and buttons/links will not bring you to another page. It's just a prototype but we're working to give you users more functions.

We're currently working in a responsive version but we decided to release this first one and listen to our community feedback to bring more updates beyond a responsive version.

### Home Page

* Navbar is properly working and bringing you to all the website sections.
  
* You can click on each icon and a flying window we'll appear to you according to the functions that you've selected.

### New Arrival

* You can slide this menu or wait the slide bar to automatically change the products. There's a little delay for this action.

* All product boxes have animations and buttons but the buttons will not bring you to anywhere yet.

### Our Products

* You can hover your mouse over the products and the cart icon to see some animations and cool visual stuff we did. 

* Buttons are not working yet.

### Reviews and Footer

* There are some simulated reviews that you can hover your mouse and see some animation.

* You'll se a pointer but you the reviews will not bring you to anywhere yet.
